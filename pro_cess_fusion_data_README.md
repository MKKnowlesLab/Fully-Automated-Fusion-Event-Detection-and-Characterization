Pro_cess_fusion_data has all steps of analysis (from background enhancement to file output with fusion event characterization) combined in single file.
This make it easier to loop through an entire data set using one file and therefore a simple command. 
Each step of the analysis code split into a its own file is also posted and can help with understanding the code.
